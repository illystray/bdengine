# Create 3D models in Minecraft without mods and resource packs
**[Try it in a browser](https://bdengine.app/)**

## What is a Display Entity?
Display Entities - new Minecraft 1.19.4 entities they allow you to "put" any block, item, or text with any transformations, and are visible to everyone without mods.
BDEngine turns them into "digital LEGO" for builders, events, and servers.

## Interactive modeling
- Move, rotate, scale and mirror objects.
- Group parts, change pivot points.
- Undo/Redo and hotkeys - feels like professional 3D software, but right in the browser.

# Animation in two clicks

- Start the animation with a single command.

## Proprietary textures without resource packs
- Draw directly in BDEngine using Custom Heads.
- Create unique blocks and models for maps, minigames and lobbies while staying on a clean server.

## Cloud, Synchronization and Save History
- Keep working on your projects from any computer with an internet connection.
- Cloud projects are synchronized and available even when the server is unavailable.
- A history of the last 100 saves. Roll back to a previous state in one click.

# Ecosystem
